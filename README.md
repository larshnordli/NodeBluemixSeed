# Node.js + Express Bluemix Seed with integration to Watson Sercive and Delivery Pipeline

The Node.js Starter demonstrates a simple, reusable Node.js web application based on the Express framework.

## Try me
A Node.js Seed application on Bluemix, with a pre-configured Delivery Pipeline.
This app is a proof-of-concept, but also intended for quickly setting up Prototypes.
Click the ***"Deploy to Bluemix""***-button and start developing your Angular app, with best-practices as project structure, route management, Watson Service Integration, and deployment to a test environment and production environment.

Press this button, to get your own copy of the sample running in Bluemix! It clones the project, creates Bluemix Toolchain, one Test App, one Production App and generates multi-stage pipeline that deploys applications to IBM Bluemix.
